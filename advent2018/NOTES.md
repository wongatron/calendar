## Advent Calendar Format / Ideas

Add a call for articles - like the F# Advent Calendar -  everyone can "claim" a day and commit to write / publish a post on this
day.

Dear #fsharp people, please help me fill #FsAdvent till Nov 1 


Rules are very simple:

1. Choose F# related topic for your blog post and reserve the slot on Twitter or leave a comment to this post. Please note that you do not have to announce the topic until the date.
2. Prepare a blog post in English
3. Publish your post on a specified date (according to the calendar)
4. Post the link to your post on Twitter with hashtags #fsharp and #FsAdvent.
